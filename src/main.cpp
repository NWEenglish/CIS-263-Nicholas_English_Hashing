/**********************************************************************
 * This program creates a hashmap that hashes based on name. The
 * purpose of this program is to see how different hashing functions
 * might affect collisions.
 *
 * The program will read in the superhero.csv database file. It will
 * then split each line and create a Superhero object wih it and then
 * store it. The program will also simultaneously keep track of the
 * amount of collisions that occure. At the end, the program will send
 * a copy of the hash function text as well as the number of collisions
 * that occurred during the course of inserting all the superheroes
 * into the hashmap.
